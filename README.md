To develop a comprehensive Internship Management System (IMS) catering to students 
seeking internships, allowing them to input vital details such as company name, address, 
internship duration, mode (remote/on-site), and stipend amount. 

The platform should enable students to update the status of their internships, including offers of Pre-Placement Offers 
(PPOs). Furthermore, the system should include options for students to apply for On Duty 
(OD), incorporating a faculty approval system for OD requests, where faculty can approve or 
reject requests with the option to add remarks if rejected. 

An admin dashboard is essential for generating insightful reports through intuitive charts, highlighting statistics such as 
companies offering the most internships to provide valuable insights into internship trends. 
Additionally, faculty members must be able to post announcements on the dashboard to 
convey important information to the students. This system aims to streamline and simplify 
the internship management process, enhancing efficiency and support for both students and 
faculty.
